# Road Trip Weather Planner

##Description
Creating an application to help people with properly dressing for their road trips across the united states. When I search for a location then it will get added onto a list with the weather suggestion. 

##APIs
- Weather
- Google Maps

##User Story 
As a road tripper

I want to know the weather of the places that are along my road trip

so that i can properly pack my bags with the appropriate outfits

##Rough Breakdown of Tasks
- folder structure enforcement (everything should be lined up the same way, structurally within our data files)
- wireframe sketch of application design
- pseudocode to get idea of the inner workings 
- look into various css stylings and create html skeleton
- build code
- error checking
- presentation prep

##Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a road trip weather planner
WHEN I search for a city at a specific timeframe
THEN I am presented with the weather conditions for the specified days and that city and it is added to my road trip AND depending on the temp range I will view a list of possible outfit items to wear
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I add a city to my road trip planner 
THEN I can also view the distance and time it'll take to drive between locations 

##MVP

In order to meet the requirements of having two seperate API's we are going to build an application that allows you to start planning a roadtrip that includes details about distance, time of travel, and the weather conditions for the total of days you plan to stay that include clothing suggestions to pack appropiate clothing. Each item that is added should appear on a list that our user can switch around and or click to then view the weather conditions and adjust how many days they will spend in that location.
