# Road Trip Weather Planner

## Description
This project was created within a team consisting of Claire, Arona, and Jennifer. We created an application to help people with properly dressing for their road trips across the united states and or to help them in their planning altogether. Our hope is to solve the problem of picking ill-fitted clothing for the weather conditions you may encounter on a trip along with possibly even canceling a trip if the weather is less than acceptable to the user. This project invoked an incredible amount of learning from among each memeber in the team in their own respective ways. However, what we all equally experienced was learning how to properly work with one another. Which as of now, we feel much more comfortable with the idea of breaking down tasks/asking for help/and working on a project in Github. ~

## Usage

When you first load the webpage you will be introduced to the landing page which serves soley as an introduction to the main application. Once you move past here you are presented with a form on the left hand side where you will enter in all the details required followed by clicking the save button which will trigger the right hand side to populate with all of the weather data for the various days and locations along your trip. From here you can either select the clear button and revert the form back to it's empty state.
